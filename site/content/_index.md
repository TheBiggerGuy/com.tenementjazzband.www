## About the Band

Tenement Jazz band are a traditional jazz band formed in early 2018 in Edinburgh, Scotland. Brought together by their shared love of New Orleans music, and comprising musicians from various corners of Edinburghâ€™s vibrant jazz scene, they are on a journey of exploration back to the roots of the music that they play.

Their aims are to capture the raw energy and excitement of the early jazz recordings, to find and revive lesser-heard songs and cultivate their own interpretations of these, all in order to captivate experienced jazzers, dancing persons, and uninitiated ears alike.

In their brief existence so far they have performed at Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Dundee and Glasgow Jazz Festivals, collaborated with various musicians via their own Cellar Session residency, and performed their own hit show on the Edinburgh Fringe telling the story of the 'Red Hot Roots of Jazz' from turn of the century New Orleans and beyond.
