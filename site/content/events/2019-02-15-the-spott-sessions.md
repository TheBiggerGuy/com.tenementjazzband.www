The Spott Session - Tenement Jazz Band

Following a hugely successful sell-out run at the Edinburgh Fringe and Jazz festivals, Spott Community Association are incredibly proud to be able to bring the Tenement Jazz Band to East Lothian for what is sure to be an amazing evening of New Orleans Style Jazz.

The Band aims are to capture the raw energy and excitement of the early jazz recordings, to find and revive lesser-heard songs and cultivate their own interpretations of these, all in order to captivate experienced jazzers, dancing persons, and uninitiated ears alike.

In their brief existence so far they have performed at Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Glasgow Jazz Festivals, collaborated with various musicians via their own Cellar Session residency, and performed their own hit show on the Edinburgh Fringe telling the story of the 'Red Hot Roots of Jazz' from turn of the century New Orleans and beyond.

Doors open and bar from 7.30 pm, music starts at 8 pm.
